## Usage

### Extract text

```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.text :as text])
(text/extract "test/pdfs/hello.pdf")
```

### Merge multiple PDFs

```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.merge :as pdf])
(pdf/merge-pdfs :input ["test/pdfs/clojure-1.pdf" "test/pdfs/clojure-2.pdf"] :output "foo.pdf")
```

### Overlay one PDF over another

```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.overlay :as pdf-overlay])
(pdf-overlay/overlay-pdf
  {:input-file-path "test/pdfs/clojure-1.pdf"
   :overlay-file-path "test/pdfs/clojure-2.pdf"
   :output-file-path "test/pdfs/foo.pdf"})
```

### Merge multiple images into single PDF

You can use either `merge-images-from-path` for providing images in
form of vector of string paths or `merge-images-from-byte-array` to
provide them as a vector of byte arrays. Each image will be inserted
into its own page.


```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.merge :as pdf])
(pdf/merge-images-from-path ["image1.png" "image2.png"] "output.pdf")
```

### Split a PDF into mutliple PDDocuments
```clojure
 (require '[pdfboxing.split :as pdf])
```
List of PDDocument pages 1 through 8
```clojure
 (pdf/split-pdf :input "test/pdfs/multi-page.pdf" :start 1 :end 8)
```
Splits the PDF into single pages as a list of PDDocument
```clojure
 (pdf/split-pdf :input "test/pdfs/multi-page.pdf")
```
Splits the PDF in half and writes them to disk as multi-page-1.pdf and multi-page-2.pdf
```clojure
 (pdf/split-pdf-at :input "test/pdfs/multi-page.pdf")
```
Splits into two PDFs, the first having 5 pages and second has rest
```clojure
 (pdf/split-pdf-at :input "test/pdfs/multi-page.pdf" :split 5)
```

### List form fields of a PDF

To list fields and values:

```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.form :as form])
(form/get-fields "test/pdfs/interactiveform.pdf")
{"Emergency_Phone" "", "ZIP" "", "COLLEGE NO DEGREE" "", ...}
```
### Fill in PDF forms

To fill in form's field supply a hash map with field names and desired
values. It will create a copy of **fillable.pdf** as **new.pdf** with
the fields filled in:

```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.form :as form])
(form/set-fields "test/pdfs/fillable.pdf" "test/pdfs/new.pdf" {"Text10" "My first name"})
```

### Rename form fields of a PDF

To rename PDF form fields, supply a hash map where the keys are the
current names and the values new names:

```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.form :as form])
(form/rename-fields "test/pdfs/interactiveform.pdf" "test/pdfs/addr1.pdf" {"Address_1" "NewAddr"})
```
### Get page count of a PDF document

```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.info :as info])
(info/page-number "test/pdfs/interactiveform.pdf")
```
### Get info about a PDF document

Such as title, author, subject, keywords, creator & producer

```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.info :as info])
(info/about-doc "test/pdfs/interactiveform.pdf")
```

### Draw lines on a PDF document

Supply a PDF document, a name for the output PDF document, the
coordinates where the line should be drawn along with the page number
on which the line should be drawn

```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.draw :as draw])
(draw/draw-line :input-pdf "test/pdfs/clojure-1.pdf"
                :output-pdf "ninja.pdf"
                :coordinates {:page-number 0
                              :x 0
                              :y 160
                              :x1 650
                              :y1 160})
```

## Compatibility with PDFBox's PDDocuments

The following functions referenced above have direct compatibility
with PDFBox's internal PDDocument type:

- `text/extract`
- `pdf/split-pdf`
- `form/get-fields`
- `form/set-fields`
- `form/rename-fields`
- `info/page-number`
- `draw/draw-line`

This allows you to substitute each filepath (of each function's input)
referenced above with a PDDocument type.  This is helpful for example
in the case that you were to want to split a PDF up by pages and then
extract the text from *only* the 3rd page:

```clojure
(require '[pdfboxing.text :as text])
(require '[pdfboxing.split :as split])
(-> (split/split-pdf :input "test/pdfs/multi-page.pdf")
    (nth 2)
    text/extract)
```
