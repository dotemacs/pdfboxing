  e.g. (rename-fields \"input.pdf\" \"output.pdf\" {\"foo\" \"bar\"})
  will create a new PDF document output.pdf with a field foo renamed
  to bar.

  If the field to be renamed is nested, only partial name of the field
  is renamed. For example in this `fields-map`:

  {\"foo\" {\"foo.0\" \"bar\"}}

  the result will be that foo.0 is now renamed to foo.bar.

  But if you were to rename foo into bar, where foo is the top level
  field name, then all the children of the foo would also be
  renamed. For this `fields-map`:

  {\"foo\" \"bar\"}

  and if the foo field looked like:

  {\"foo\" {\"foo.0\" \"x\" \"foo.1\" \"y\"}}

  the results would be:

  {\"bar\" {\"bar.0\" \"x\" \"bar.1\" \"y\"}}."
